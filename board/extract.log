#   NOTE: The extract for slot holes MUST(!) appear first so that it is
#         executed first!!! If the extract for route paths is executed
#         first and the board should NOT(!) have an NCROUTE_PATH subclass,
#         the entire extract is immediately terminated without getting
#         slots extracted. With slots done first any slots are extracted,
#         and if the route extract should fail, a zero length output is
#         created for the routes.
